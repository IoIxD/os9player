# ppcplayer

Work in progress attempt to get an ffmpeg based video player on Mac OS 9 and other PowerPC based computers\*. Why? We don't ask those questions.

[See the supported codecs](https://github.com/IoIxD/ppcplayer/wiki/Supported-Codecs).

To download (when it's ready), see the releases sidebar. To build from source, just use `./build.sh`.

\* Desktop or laptop computers with a keyboard, mouse, etc. Consoles like the Wii are not targetted here; the Wii in particular already has a modern ffmpeg based video player for it.
